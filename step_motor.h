/* .h is a header file - it defines classes, functions, etc. Wherever you need
  to use these, you simply #include "thisfile.h". That copies the contents of this
  file verbatim to the place where you #include it. Now, the problem is what if
  it would end up getting included twice? So we use this little trick:
  
  #ifndef  XXXX   says "only read if macro XXXX is not defined
  #define  XXXX   says "define macro XXXX"
  
  So, the first time around, XXXX is not defined and the .h file gets included.
  If it is included again, XXXX is already defined and the contents of the .h is ignored
  There is no executable code in here. Just definitions.
